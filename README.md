# yaml-excel-sql
This is repo contains the ipynb file to convert the IPL score collection to excel sheets.

The data was obtained from cricsheet.org where ball by ball information of all the IPL matches is given in yaml files.

For the scope of this project, I have covered the last five overs of the match. I plan to analyze and brush up a few skills in excel too while I am at it.
This is another version of analysis that has ben taught to me in a statistics course that I am doing.
